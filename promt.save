This is a **Master Prompt** designed for high-end coding models (like Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or GPT-4o). It contains every technical detail, psychological constraint, and system-specific requirement we have built.

**COPY AND PASTE THE FOLLOWING PROMPT:**

**Role:** You are a Senior Behavioral Engineer and Systems Architect specializing in Arch Linux (specifically the Omarchy distribution), Hyprland (Wayland), and Python GUI development (PyQt6).

**The Mission:** Create a "Digital Frontal Lobe" application called **"The Overman Protocol"**. This app is a strict behavioral enforcer for a user with 97th Percentile Intellect but a recent collapse in Conscientiousness (dropping from 64% to 43%). The user has ADHD (time blindness) and OCD tendencies. The app is designed to bridge the gap between their high potential and low discipline.

**System Environment:**

* **OS:** Arch Linux (Omarchy)
* **Compositor:** Hyprland (Wayland)
* **Hardware:** Low-spec (4GB RAM, Intel Pentium). Code must be efficient.
* **Tools Available:** `hyprctl` (window polling), `grim` (screenshots), `espeak-ng` (Text-to-Speech), `smtplib` (Email reporting).

**Visual & Philosophical Style:**

* **Brutalist / Industrial Dark Mode:** Background `#050505`, Text `#f0f0f0`, Accents `#00ff00` (Success) and `#ff0000` (Failure).
* **Tone:** Nietzschean, cold, and objective. Use quotes like "He who cannot obey himself will be commanded."

**Mandatory Features:**

1. **The Architect (Startup Planner):**
* On launch, block the screen with a "Pre-Flight Check" window.
* User must input: **Micro-Goal**, **Duration (mins)**, and **Allowed Apps** (comma-separated whitelist).
* Once "Engaged," spawn the Dashboard, the Warden thread, and the Overlay.


2. **The Warden (Background Thread):**
* Poll `hyprctl activewindow -j` every 2 seconds.
* **App Killer:** If window title/class contains banned keywords (`porn`, `xxx`, `social media`, etc.), immediately run `hyprctl dispatch closewindow`.
* **Drift Sentinel:** If user is in a non-whitelisted app (like a browser) for >60s, use `espeak-ng` to give an auditory warning: "Samidu, focus. Return to your goal."
* **10-Minute Audit:** Every 10 minutes, use `grim` to capture a screenshot and trigger the **Lockout Window**.


3. **The Lockout Window (The Prison):**
* A fullscreen, frameless window that stays focused and covers all monitors.
* Displays the captured screenshot of the user's activity.
* Requires the user to type a randomly chosen Nietzschean mantra (e.g., "i command myself") to unlock.


4. **The Dashboard (The Command Center):**
* **Shame Mirror:** A sidebar permanently displaying the user's psychometric data: "INTELLECT: 97th %", "CONSCIENTIOUSNESS: 43% (FAILURE)", "ORGANIZATION: 9th % (CHAOS)".
* **Hierarchical Analytics:** A `QTreeWidget` showing real-time window tracking:
`Today History (Total Time)`
`├── [App Class] (Total Time in App)`
`│   └── [Window Title/URL] (Time spent on this specific task)`
* **Willpower Distribution:** A live Matplotlib pie chart showing "Productive" vs "Drifting" time.


5. **The Overlay (Time Anchor):**
* A tiny, pinned, non-interactive bar in the top-right corner.
* Visual countdown bar and clock to cure ADHD time-blindness.


6. **The Eternal Recurrence (Accountability):**
* **Volatile Storage:** All data must be kept in RAM-only for the session.
* **Email Reporting:** On session end, compile the hierarchical activity tree and focus ratio. Email the report and the last "shame screenshot" to `schattenbyte0x.de@gmail.com`.



**Technical Constraint:**

* Consolidate all logic into **one single Python file** (`main.py`).
* Use `QThread` for the Warden to prevent GUI freezing.
* Ensure `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` is set to `wayland`.
